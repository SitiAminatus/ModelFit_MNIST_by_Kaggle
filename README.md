# ModelFit_MNIST_by_Kaggle
This project is aimed to predict handwriting which dataset is provided by kaggle 

Here the following path of our project:
1. Read data by converting original dataset into numpy using idx2numpy
2. data exploration
3. data split
4. implement model
5. fit model and evaluate model
6. hyperparameter tuning 
7. visualize data

this stage cover 5 first-steps mentioned above
